## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **REMOVED BLUE BLOCKING OVERLAY**
**File:** `web/src/app/map/page.tsx`

**Problem:** 
- Overlapping hint message at `bottom-32` was creating a blue glass overlay that blocked half the screen

**Fix:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: Had overlapping hint div
<motion.div className="absolute bottom-32 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 z-10">
  <div className="glass rounded-xl px-4 py-2">
    <p>Tap a glowing marker to select a spot</p>
  </div>
</motion.div>

// AFTER: Removed completely, map is now fully clear
<div className="relative h-screen w-screen overflow-hidden bg-gray-900">
  <TomTomMapFinal ... />
  <Navigation />
</div>
```

**Result:** ✅ Map now displays full screen with no blue blocking overlay

---

### 2. **FIXED MARKER HOVER FLYING ISSUE**
**File:** `web/src/components/TomTomMapFinal.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Popup was positioned with `bottom: 50px` which caused it to break out of marker bounds
- Marker would "fly" to the side when hovering

**Fix:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: Incorrect positioning
popup.style.cssText = `
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 50px;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  ...
`

// AFTER: Correct positioning above marker
popup.style.cssText = `
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 100%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-10px);
  white-space: normal;
  max-width: 300px;
  z-index: 10000;
  ...
`

// Also reduced scale to prevent jitter
markerEl.style.transform = 'scale(1.15)' // Was 1.2, now 1.15
markerEl.style.zIndex = '1000' // Increased z-index
```

**Result:** ✅ Markers now hover smoothly with popup appearing directly above them

---

### 3. **FIXED CLICK-TO-SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY**
**File:** `web/src/components/TomTomMapFinal.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Previous markers were not being cleared when clicking a new location
- Markers would accumulate on the map

**Fix:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: No clearing
map.on('click', (e: any) => {
  const { lng, lat } = e.lngLat
  console.log('🗺️ Map clicked:', { lat, lng })
  searchNearbyParking(lat, lng)
})

// AFTER: Clear markers before searching
map.on('click', (e: any) => {
  const { lng, lat } = e.lngLat
  console.log('🗺️ Map clicked:', { lat, lng })
  clearMarkers() // 🔥 Clear previous markers
  searchNearbyParking(lat, lng)
})
```

**Result:** ✅ Click-to-search now works correctly, clearing old markers before showing new ones

---

### 4. **IMPROVED MAP CONTAINER SIZING**
**File:** `web/src/components/TomTomMapFinal.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Map container had minimum height constraint and was not truly full screen

**Fix:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: Relative container with min-height
<div className="relative w-full h-full">
  <div ref={mapContainer} className="absolute inset-0 bg-gray-900" style={{ minHeight: '400px' }} />
</div>

// AFTER: Absolute container with full coverage
<div className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full">
  <div ref={mapContainer} className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full bg-gray-900" />
</div>
```

**Result:** ✅ Map now fills entire screen with no constraints
